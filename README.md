<details><summary><h2>Loot Icons   ðŸ“Œ</h2></summary>
  The standalone version of DayZ changed the way mining works to a large extent. Almost every building is now available and has almost the same chance for items of the same type.

  But there are special buildings containing war loot, farms and more. We will highlight these special buildings and add many important landmarks to help users find their current location on the map.

These attractions will include lighthouses, water towers, ponds, deer, water pumps, and more.
