<details><summary><h2>Loot Icons   ðŸ“Œ</h2></summary>
  The standalone version of DayZ changed the way mining works to a large extent. Almost every building is now available and has almost the same chance for items of the same type.<br>
  <br>
  But there are special buildings containing <i>war loot</i>, <i>farms</i> and <i>more</i>. We will highlight these special buildings and add many important landmarks to help users find their current location on the map.<br>
<br>
These attractions will include <i>lighthouses</i>, <i>water towers</i>, <i>ponds</i>, <i>deer</i>, <i>water pumps</i>, and <b>more</b>.
