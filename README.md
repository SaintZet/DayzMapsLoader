Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

  DayZ is an postapocalyptic open world zombie survival game set on the map of Chernarus which is based on a real rural area in the czech republic.
  
  You are a lonely survivor - hungry, and lost in this huge hostile world. Search through the abandoned remains of civilication for food and weapons, fend of zombies and survive against other human players.

<details><summary><h2>Maps  ðŸ—º</h2></summary>
  iZurvive offers a large variety of maps for the DayZ Standalone, the DayZ Mod and ARMA. Chernarus+ (the map of DayZ Standalone) even comes with two different types:

A topographic map that is useful for navigating by using contours, highlighted roads, buildings, rail tracks, and much more.
A satellite map which allows a focus on the game's terrain.
For the DayZ Mod, we support the classical Chernarus map as well as additional maps, such as:

Namalsk: The famous mod featuring a winter setting
Taviana: A DayZ mod with a whole new map in a mediterranean area
Origins: One of the most played DayZ Mods using a derivative of Taviana

</details>

<details><summary><h2>Loot Icons   ðŸ“Œ</h2></summary>
  The DayZ standalone version has largely changed the way how loot works. Almost every building is now accessible and has pretty much the same chances for the same kind of items. But there are special buildings which contain military loot, farms, and many more. iZurvive highlights these special buildings and adds many important landmarks which help users find their current location on the map. These landmarks include light houses, water towers, ponds, deer stands, water pumps, and many more.
